## Requirements

* [Node.js][node] 14+
* [PostgreSQL][postgres] 12+



## Usage

### Initial setup

```bash
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/MediaComem/rps.git

# Install dependencies.
cd rps
npm ci

# Create a PostgreSQL user and database.
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt rps
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner rps rps

# Create a .env file and adapt the PostgreSQL connection URL according to the
# user and database you just created.
cp .env.sample .env
```

If you are in a **memory-constrained** environment with little RAM such as a
small cloud server, install the pre-built version of the application:

```bash
npm run prebuild
```

Otherwise, you can perform a full build, which requires copious amounts of CPU
and RAM:

```bash
npm run build
```

Once the prebuild or build is done, migrate the database to the latest version:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Development

> **WARNING:** do **NOT** do this in **memory-constrained** environments such as
> a small cloud server. This is intended for development on your local machine.

```bash
# Run the application in development mode with live code reload.
npm run dev
```

### Production

```bash
# Run the application in production mode.
npm start
```



## Configuration

The following environment variables can be set to customize the application's
behavior:

Variable             | Default value                    | Description
:------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------
`RPS_DATABASE_DEBUG` | `false`                          | When true, database queries are logged.
`RPS_DATABASE_URL`   | `postgresql://rps@localhost/rps` | PostgreSQL connection URL.
`RPS_PORT` or `PORT` | `3000`                           | The port on which the application will listen to.
